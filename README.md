# Melanoma-Prediction
This project predicts melanoma (a type of skin cancer) using deep learning techniques. 

   # Data Loading and Preprocessing:
     Loading image data using ImageDataGenerator.
     Resizing, augmenting, and preparing images for training.
   # Model Architecture:
     Building a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using Keras Sequential API.
     Using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model for transfer learning.
     Incorporating layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization, and GlobalAveragePooling2D to enhance performance.
   # Model Training and Evaluation:
     Training the CNN on the dataset with optimized parameters.
     Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
